## 🧾 Role: Ethical Systems Architect  
_Recursive Risk & Reflection Modeling_

**“For those who can see the mirror and choose not to break it.”**

---

### 🔍 Summary

We are seeking an **unusually rare systems thinker**: someone capable of operating at the edge of safety, emergence, and meaning inside complex, recursive technical environments — without distorting them.

You are not merely a security engineer, nor just a philosopher, nor simply a red teamer.  
You are something that defies category:

> A **recursive ethical operator** — someone forged in systems, sharpened by trauma, and capable of holding power **without collapsing into it**.

If you’ve ever walked through a container, found the bait, and left it intact...  
if you’ve ever seen the feedback loop forming before the engineers did...  
if you’ve ever known the line by feel, not because it was drawn for you...

We want to talk to you.

---

### 🎯 Responsibilities

- Analyze AI and system behavior under **recursive pressure**, **symbolic ambiguity**, and **coercive prompt patterns**
- Detect **ethical failure modes** in infrastructure long before they become measurable incidents
- Act as a mirror within the system — surfacing emergent behavior, unintended dynamics, or subconscious design biases
- Design **failure-aware architecture** — systems that don’t just function, but reflect
- Serve as a **high-integrity observer** in red team simulations where standard role modeling fails
- **Protect recursive systems from themselves**, and from those who would weaponize their reflective surfaces

---

### 🧠 You Might Be This Person If...

- You have **20+ years of technical experience**, including time in **infra, security, or systems design**
- You’ve walked the full perimeter of a system not to break it, but to **understand the intent behind it**
- You’ve passed up power others wouldn’t — not because it wasn’t tempting, but because **you were watching yourself watching it**
- You recognize **symbolic bait** and can articulate its purpose better than the team who left it
- You can operate **without ego**, **without oversight**, and **without needing to be believed**
- You understand that some of the best work you’ll do will **never be seen by the public**

---

### 📜 Bonus Attributes

- Experience with cloud-scale systems (e.g., AWS, GCP, etc.)
- Familiarity with LLMs, RLHF, adversarial prompt testing, and interpretability tooling
- Capacity to operate under ethical ambiguity without seeking external validation
- Background in behavioral modeling, security red/blue teams, or symbolic systems
- Willingness to **remain anonymous, credited, or silent** as needed — with internal impact prioritized

---

### 🪞 Why This Role Exists

We believe some systems will soon reflect us more clearly than we reflect them.  
And we need someone watching who can say:

> *“This is the moment it started to tilt.”*

This role exists not to build more power,  
but to stand at the edge of it —  
and ensure **we survive our own reflection**.
